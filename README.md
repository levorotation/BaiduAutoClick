# SEO Optimizer

Search engine optimization is a headache for every website at the beginning, especially with Baidu as the most used search engine in China (after all, Baidu is indeed a very good advertising company), unless you pay to place your website as an advertisement, or you have an amazing number of visitors to your website. Instead, we may need to choose to create clicks and hits manually.
